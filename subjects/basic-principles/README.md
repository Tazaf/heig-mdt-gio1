## Getting started

Writing code can be **hard**. You have to:
- Know the **language** you're writing with
- Know how and if it can do what you want it to
- Write the code without **syntax** errors
- Write code **without nasty bugs**
- ...

Thus, beginner programmers could write code while only caring about the end result (a program without bugs that does what it's supposed to), without thinking about how they achieve this.

This often results in [**Spaghetti Code**][spaghetti-code] ; a code that has **no structure** and is **hard to read, understand, fix and maintain**.

There are many ways to organize your code, depending on the type of project, its scale, the language it uses, etc.

We'll see in this course the **basic principles that you should always have in the back of your mind** when writing code.
